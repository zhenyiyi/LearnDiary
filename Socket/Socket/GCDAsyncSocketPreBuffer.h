/**
 * A PreBuffer is used when there is more data available on the socket
 * than is being requested by current read request.
 * In this case we slurp up all data from the socket (to minimize sys calls),
 * and store additional yet unread data in a "prebuffer".
 *
 * The prebuffer is entirely drained before we read from the socket again.
 * In other words, a large chunk of data is written is written to the prebuffer.
 * The prebuffer is then drained via a series of one or more reads (for subsequent read request(s)).
 *
 * A ring buffer was once used for this purpose.
 * But a ring buffer takes up twice as much memory as needed (double the size for mirroring).
 * In fact, it generally takes up more than twice the needed size as everything has to be rounded up to vm_page_size.
 * And since the prebuffer is always completely drained after being written to, a full ring buffer isn't needed.
 *
 * The current design is very simple and straight-forward, while also keeping memory requirements lower.
